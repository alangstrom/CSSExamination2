          <h3>What are hex colors?</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>A hex triplet is a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the
            range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the True Color (24-bit RGB) color scheme.
            The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:
            <p>Byte 1: red value (color type red)</p>
            <p>Byte 2: green value (color type green)</p>
            <p>Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)</p>


            <p>For example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively.
              The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the 6 hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example. If any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet
              always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810. The number of colors that can be represented by this system is 2563 or 224 or 166
              = 16,777,216.</p>

          <h3>Why are they useful?</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Hex color values guarantee color fidelity and matching across a choice of 16,777,216 colors. HTML and CSS color choices are limited to 140 colors. "140 color names are defined in the HTML5 and CSS3 color specifications. 17 colors are from the
            HTML specification, 123 colors are from the CSS specification."</p>
          <p>Additionally, if you’re coding, and want to keep webpages to a minimum, hex coding will save you bytes, and will look more structured and organized. Eg: if you have a table with different values, hex code will make the code look more easy to
            understand, while color names might make the code look more disorganized, and are harder to understand; like: which type of red between the three, looks the lightest?</p>

          <p id="indian-red">Indian red, #CD5C5C </p>
          <p id="light-coral">Light Coral, #F08080</p>
          <p id="salmon">Salmon, #FA8072</p>

          <p>Hex values will tell you at a glance how much of RED, Green, and Blue are in the color.</p>

          <h3>Why create this site?</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Creating a site dedicated to short and fleeting descriptions of what hex code colors are might seem like a waste of time - but not quite! This site was designed as part of an assignment in the course "CSS-Baserad Webbdesign". The goal was to
            use the aquired knowledge from the course and create a website dedicated to a certain subject. Due to a lack of imagination hex code colors was the choice of theme.</div>
